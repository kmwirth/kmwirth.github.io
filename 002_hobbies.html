  <h1>My Hobbies</h1> 

  <h2>Traveling </h2>
    <p> I love traveling to places with beaches and mountains, as well as exploring the city!<p>

  <h2>Baking</h2>
    <p> I have loved to bake ever since I was young, but recently some of my favorite things to make have been PB&J cookies, scones, and cupcakes! <p>

  <h2> Sports </h2>

    <p> Finally, both playing and watching sports has always been a significant part of my life, and something I love to do! I am a big fan of the Badgers (obviously!) and the Packers as well! <p>
